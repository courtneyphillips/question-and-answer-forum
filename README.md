#GNARledge

---

## Synopsis

GNARledge was built by [Courtney Phillips](https://github.com/courtneymaepdx). Crafted as part of the Spring 2015 JavaScript and Ember.js course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/).

## Motivation

GNARledge was created as an exercise in Ember.js app creation, especially with forms, database associations, library dependencies, and aesthetically-pleasing styles. 

## Functionality

GNARledge is a basic 'wilderness survival'-themed internet forum where users can post questions, and "experts" can peruse all available questions and post corresponding answers when applicable. Just like "Yahoo Answers", but hopefully a bit easier on the eyes.

- Aesthetic fixes, including adding additional images.
- More 'eloquent' jQuery transitions and effects.
- Expanded functionality, including ability create accounts.
- Two tiers of accounts; basic user account, and verified "expert" account for those that can prove their relevant education/experience in the field.
- Ability to add categories/tags to questions.
- Ability to sort by whatever tags, or combination of tags.
- Search functionality.

## Other Credit

GNARledge's website design utilizes _portions_ of the 'Greyscale' theme from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/), which can be viewed in its original/full capacity [here](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-grayscale).
