#Pizza Party

---

## Synopsis

Pizza Party built by [Courtney Phillips](https://github.com/courtneymaepdx). Crafted as part of the Spring 2015 JavaScript course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/).

## Motivation

Pizza Party was created as an exercise in Object-Oriented JavaScript in conjuction with jQuery.  

## Functionality

Pizza Party is a website that takes online orders for a fictional pizza delivery service. Users are prompted to provide a name, and are then taken to a form to add pizzas of their choosing to their order (they have options for different sizes, toppings, etc.) Upon adding each pizza, the user can either opt to add another, or proceed to review their order and check out. A rudimentary receipt with cost breakdown is provided to the user.

## Tests

Both tests for Pizza Party utilize both Mocha and Chai. Simply run the spec-runner.html file (located in the spec folder) in order to see real-time test results. Any additional tests may be written to the specs.js folder, and run in the same method.
